# Updated-Plotly_chart

1. This dataset shows that a small handful of microbial species (a.k.a. operational taxonomic units, or OTUs, in the study) were present in more than 70% of people, while the rest were relatively rare.

2. The dataset also shows that the majority of the OTUs are present in the majority of people.

3. Following the previous analysis, we can conclude that the majority of the OTUs are present in the majority of people.

4. STEPS : 
    . Compare OTUs of the individual sample using bar chart
    . Compare OTUs of the individual sample using bubble map
    . Belly washing frequency of the individual
    . A dashboard to show the most common OTUs in the dataset using multiple charts

The project was created using D3.js and plotly library. The main Goal of the project is to show the user the most common OTUs in the dataset. Also visualizations are provided to show the OTUs in the dataset using bar chart and bubble map. Also i have created a frequency of belly washing of the individual. Multiple files are in the project. main work is inside the static\js folder which is later on included in the index.html file updated constantly. CSS file is also included in the project. All the necessary files contaning the data and updated images of the dashboard are also provided inside the parent directory. Snapshots of main dashboard is provided inside the images folder. Frequency gauge chart and other necessary images are inside the images folder.
